How to use

Installation

1. Download a plugin release (the last is recommended) from above.
2. Choose the SW_svile_php*.phar file according to your php version.
3. Extract the file into the plugins/ folder of your server and restart it.
4. Done, you can now join the game and create arenas (SkyWars_mini-games).

How to create an arena

1. Teleport yourself in the world where you would like to create it (not default one).
2. Now you can use the command /sw create [SWname] [slots] [countdown] [maxGameTime] to create an arena.
3. Go back in the arena world and depending on its spawns/slots use the command /sw setspawn [slot] x times.
4. Place a sign with sw in the 1st line and SWname in the 2nd.
5. Done, now players can tap the sign to join the game!

Commands

These commands cannot be used in console.

Command	Description
/sw	SW main command, shows the usage (subcommands)
/sw create [SWname] [slots] [countdown] [maxGameTime]	It's used for creating arenas.
- SWname indicates the name of the arena, is used for distinguish arenas, for example on join signs.
- slots indicates the number of spawns of the arena
- countdown is the time in seconds before the game starts.
- maxGameTime is the time in seconds after the countdown, if go over this, the game will finish.
/sw setspawn [slot]	It's used to set each spawn using the CommandSender position.
- slot indicates the number of the slot. Example: an arena with 4 slots need 4 different spawns; to set these 4 spawns you need to run this command 4 times: /sw setspawn 1, /sw setspawn 2, /sw setspawn 3, /sw setspawn 4.
If you set spawns above glass, it will be broken once the game starts.
/sw list	Displays the list of loaded arenas with the corresponding world + players playing in them. Example: TestArena [5/16] => TestWorld etc.
/sw delete [SWname]	This command just deletes an arena.
- SWname is the name of the arena that you must give to delete it
/sw signdelete [SWname|all]	Do you want to delete a join sign but you forgot where you placed it? This command can help you.
- SWname is the arena name, if gived, all the signs pointing to the given arena will be deleted.
- all If used as the arena name like /sw signdelete all, all the SW signs wil be deleted.
Are you thinking this command is useless? You'll change your idea about it when you'll have the need.üòÜ
